"""
Write a separate program that uses polynomials to approximate values of logarithms. For this 
program, the core function will compute values of the natural log only for inputs of 1 to âˆš2 and 
other functions will use properties of logarithms to extend the allowed inputs.  
 
Necessary constants: LN2 = np.log(2) and  SQRT2 = np.sqrt(2)
